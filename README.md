## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains thousands of video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.

# VetCare Laravel Application

A comprehensive veterinary care management system built with Laravel, featuring appointment booking, doctor management, and pet care tracking.

## Features

- üîê **Authentication & Authorization** (Sanctum + Spatie Permissions)
- üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è **Doctor Management** with specializations and working hours
- üêï **Pet Management** with owner relationships
- üìÖ **Advanced Appointment Booking System**
- üóìÔ∏è **Calendar Integration** with availability checking

- üìä **Comprehensive API** with clean architecture

## üìÖ Appointment Booking System

The appointment system is designed with **flexibility** in mind, supporting multiple booking workflows to accommodate different user preferences.

### üéØ **Three Booking Workflows**

#### **1. Time-First Booking** ‚è∞
*Perfect for users with time constraints*

**User Journey:** "I can only come at 2:00 PM on Friday - who's available?"

```
User selects time ‚Üí System shows available doctors ‚Üí User picks doctor ‚Üí Books appointment
```

**API Flow:**
```bash
GET /api/available-doctors?date=2024-01-15&time=14:00
# Returns list of doctors available at that specific time

POST /api/appointments
# Books with selected doctor
```

#### **2. Doctor-First Booking** üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è
*Perfect for users with doctor preferences*

**User Journey:** "I want to see Dr. Smith - when is she available?"

```
User selects doctor ‚Üí System shows available times ‚Üí User picks time ‚Üí Books appointment
```

**API Flow:**
```bash
GET /api/calendar/1?date=2024-01-15
# Returns available time slots for Dr. Smith

POST /api/appointments
# Books at selected time
```

#### **3. Browse All Availability** üìã
*Perfect for flexible users*

**User Journey:** "Show me everything available this week"

```
User browses calendar ‚Üí System shows all slots ‚Üí User picks doctor + time ‚Üí Books appointment
```

**API Flow:**
```bash
GET /api/calendar?start_date=2024-01-15&end_date=2024-01-20
# Returns all available slots across all doctors

POST /api/appointments
# Books selected slot
```

### üîç **Key Endpoint: `/available-doctors`**

This endpoint is specifically designed for **time-first booking scenarios**:

**Purpose:** Find which doctors are available for a specific time slot

**When to use:**
- User has a preferred time but is flexible on doctor
- Emergency appointments where any available doctor works
- Time-constrained scheduling (e.g., "I can only come during lunch break")

**Example Response:**
```json
{
  "data": {
    "doctors": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Dr. Sarah Smith",
        "specialization": "General Veterinarian",
        "slot": {
          "start": "14:00",
          "end": "14:20",
          "date": "2024-01-15"
        }
      }
    ],
    "total_available": 1
  }
}
```

### üìä **Endpoint Comparison**

| Endpoint | Purpose | Returns | Best For |
|----------|---------|---------|----------|
| `GET /calendar` | Browse all availability | All slots for all doctors | Calendar view, general browsing |
| `GET /available-doctors` | **Time-first booking** | Available doctors for specific time | "I want 2PM Friday - who's free?" |
| `GET /calendar/{doctor}` | **Doctor-first booking** | Available times for specific doctor | "I want Dr. Smith - when is she free?" |

### üõ°Ô∏è **Business Rules**

- ‚úÖ **Pet Ownership Validation**: Users can only book for their own pets
- ‚úÖ **Time Availability**: No double-booking, respects doctor schedules
- ‚úÖ **Working Hours**: Appointments only during doctor's working hours
- ‚úÖ **Future Booking**: No past-date appointments
- ‚úÖ **Conflict Prevention**: Automatic overlap detection

```javascript
// Create treatment with automatic billing notification
const createTreatment = async (treatmentData) => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/doctor/treatments', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      medical_record_id: treatmentData.medicalRecordId,
      type: treatmentData.type,
      name: treatmentData.name,
      cost: treatmentData.cost, // Triggers automatic billing
      start_date: treatmentData.startDate
    })
  });
  
  const result = await response.json();
  
  // Show billing notification if invoice was created
  if (result.data.billing_info) {
    showNotification(
      `Invoice ${result.data.billing_info.invoice_number} created automatically for $${result.data.billing_info.amount}`
